#Documentation Again 1 - Class and Instance methods

#find the difference between File::path and File#path

#File::path is a class method that returns the string representation of a file path

#File#path is an instance method 
#it returns the pathname used to create the file as a string
#doesn't always point to the file itself
#eg, pathname becomes void when file is moved or deleted

#so similar but different function, beyond instance and class

#note: pathname refers to file's name, but not file itself
